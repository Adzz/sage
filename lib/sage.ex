  Documentation for Sage.

  ## Extensibility

  Other modules can have protocol implementations for `Sage`, eg:

    defimpl Sage, for: MyHTTPClient do


    end


    Example extensions:

    |> run_request(:post, fn )

  ## Benefits

  ### vs `with`

  ## Handling errors

  ### For transaction callback

  ### For compensating function

  What we could do:

  1. Give up. It's essentially to let it fail and let application developer to find this error in logs and fix manually.

  2. Retry. We can reduce amount of manual work by keeping retrying to compensate transaction.
  Benefits of this approach is not clear. It application has a bug - retries won't help. If connection went down - we need very large timeouts
  and sometimes internet connection won't recover at all.

  3. Spin off a compensating process and return error. Implement steps 1 or 2 in this process.



  What if Internet connection went down and compensations are failing?

  One possible solution 1s to make use of software fault tolerant techniques along
  the lmes of recovery blocks [Ande8la,Horn74a] A recovery block 1s
  an alternate or secondary block of code that 1s provided m case a
  failure 1s detected m the primary block If a failure IS detected the
  system 1s reset to Its pre-primary state and the secondary block 1s executed

  The secondary block 1s designed to achieve the same end as the primary usmg
  a different algorithm or technique, hopefully avoiding the primaryâ€™s failure


  The other possible solution to this problem
1s manual mterventlon The erroneous transaction
1s first aborted Then It 1s given to an apphcation
programmer who, given a descrlptlon of
the error, can correct it The SEC (or the apphcation)
then reruns the transactlon and contmues
processing the saga
Fortunately, while the transaction 1s bemg
manually repalred the saga does not hold any
database resources (1 e , locks) Hence, the fact
that an already long saga ~111 take even longer
will not slgmficantly affect performance of other
transactions

  ## Tracing your Sage

  If you want to set metrics and measure how much time each of your Sage execution steps took,
  you can use `after_transaction`, `before_transaction`, `after_compensation`, `before_compensation`
  callbacks.

  ...

  - `before_and_after_state` is shared across all callback runs. By default: `%{execute_args: execute_args}`.

  ## Examples

    def my_sage do
      import Sage

      new()
      |> run(:user, &create_user/2, &delete_user/3)
      |> run_cached(:plans, &fetch_subscription_plans/3)
      |> checkpoint(retry_limit: 3) # Retry everything after a checkpoint 3 times (if anything fails), `retry_timeout` is taken from `global_opts`
      |> run(:subscription, &create_subscription/2, delete_subscription/3)
      |> run_async(:delivery, &schedule_delivery/2, &delete_delivery_from_schedule/3)
      |> run_async(:receipt, &send_email_receipt/2, &send_excuse_for_email_receipt/3)
      |> run(:update_user, &set_plan_for_a_user/2, &rollback_plan_for_a_user/3)
      |> finally(&acknowledge_job/2)
    end

      pool: Poolboy.start_link(),
      retry_limit: 10,
      retry_timeout: 100,
      after_transaction: (name, before_and_after_state -> no_return),
      before_transaction: (name, before_and_after_state -> no_return),
      after_compensation: (name, before_and_after_state -> no_return),
      before_compensation: (name, before_and_after_state -> no_return),
    ]

    end
